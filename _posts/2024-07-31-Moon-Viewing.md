Dear Master Lexorius,

Greetings. I am Elias Mordran, student and researcher at Ishtar Academy. I have need of your assistance in a most delicate manner...

**Moon Viewing** was made in two weeks for [Pirate Software Jam 15](https://itch.io/jam/pirate15). It was made with [DeveloperChipmunk](https://itch.io/profile/developerchipmunk) (a co-worker of mine), [Cache31522](https://itch.io/profile/cache31522) (my brother), and Carl_Wheezer (a friend of my brother). The Jam's theme was "Shadows and Alchemy".

### The Plan

At first I didn't love this theme, "Shadows and Alchemy". There were other themes offered that I thought were much cooler, like "Dying Planet". I felt this one was a bit too limited, and a good game jam theme needs to be broad, maybe even have multiple meanings to work off of. But then Thor changed my mind as he spoke on how these words can be interpreted: 

- "Shadows" can be more than just the absence of light, it's also secrecy, darkness, corruption. A shadow play, a shadow government, a shadow of a doubt.
- "Alchemy" is more than just combining ingredients, it's also transformation, transmutation, or synthesizing new materials. Think turning lead into gold. It's also ciphers and encryption, since real-world alchemists would encode their recipes in paintings.

Chipmunk, Cache, and I chatted as the theme was announced, and we brainstormed the rest of the day. By evening, Cache and I had two strong ideas, but we went with mine.

The idea was convoluted, complex, dense even. Ambitious for two weeks and four inexperienced devs. We delegated the work as we had planned, Chipmunk would do most of the programming, Cache would do the writing and some game design, Carl would do the art, and I would do all the rest, including the puzzles and solutions, music and sounds, and some programming.

We chose to use [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) almost instinctively. I had a blast working in it with a previous project (even though that game didn't turn out all that well) and the rest of the team seemed to generally have positive thoughts about the engine. I am happy with our choice, Godot is excellent.
